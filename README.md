# HospitalServerManager
It is online version of the AdmissionManager (www.github.com/SirLecram/AdmissionManager). 
I decided that I would do both projects at the same time :). This app is the client. 
I would like to implement to the client MVVM pattern. 
Responsibility for database management will be transferred to the server in Golang. 
Repository of Golang server is here: www.git.wmi.amu.edu.pl/s439397/admissionServer
